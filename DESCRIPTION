Title: A Hyper-Specific Package for Writing Slack Commands to a Google Sheet
Description: This package is for an extremely specific purpose: for taking
    'slash' commands given in a slack client and posting the input to those
    commands as cell values in a specific Google sheet. The package also
    contains functions for reading summary pages in that sheet and printing
    plain-text versions of those summary pages. Finally, the package makes
    simple plots of the data contained in the spreadsheet.
